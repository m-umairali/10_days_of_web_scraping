# 10 Days of Web Scraping

Welcome to my Github repository, "10 Days of Web Scraping"! This repository is designed to be a comprehensive resource for those interested in learning about web scraping and its various tools and techniques.

Over the course of 10 days, I will be sharing a variety of content related to web scraping using popular Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium. These libraries provide a powerful set of tools for web scraping, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses.

Beautiful Soup is a Python package that is widely used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. It is a simple and easy-to-use library that can quickly parse the HTML and XML documents and extract useful information from them.

Scrapy, on the other hand, is a powerful and flexible web scraping framework that provides a more structured and efficient way of scraping large-scale web data. It provides a convenient set of tools to extract data from websites and can be easily integrated into your own Python applications.

Finally, Selenium is a popular web testing tool that can also be used for web scraping. It allows you to automate web browsers and interact with web pages, making it ideal for scraping dynamic content that may be difficult to parse with other tools.

Throughout this repository, you will find a range of resources, including tutorials, code samples, and tips and tricks, to help you master the art of web scraping using these powerful tools. Whether you're new to web scraping or looking to refine your skills, "10 Days of Web Scraping" has something for everyone.

So, dive into the world of web scraping with me and let's explore the possibilities of data extraction from the web!
